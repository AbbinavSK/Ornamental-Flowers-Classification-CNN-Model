# Ornamental Flowers classification using Transfer learning CNN models

Classification of Ornamental flower images into 5 types using Transfer-learning and Fine-tuning of 3 popular CNNs - InceptionResNetV2, EfficientNetV2B0 and ConvNeXtTiny. Finally the best performing fine-tuned models of each are ensembled with majority-rule voting

*   *Problem*: `Image Classification`
*   *Data*: `Ornamental Flowers`
*   *Models*: `InceptionResNetV2`, `EfficientNetV2B0` and `ConvNeXtTiny`
*   *Key libraries used*: `TensorFlow Keras`, `PIL`, `Scikit-Learn`, `numpy`
